00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,011
Am I, uh...

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,567
What are we waiting for?

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,527
What?

5
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,242
The arrows.

6
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,129
Gayle's putting in
the arrows on Reagan.

7
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,289
Yeah, I know, it's...
But they said...

8
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,001
Jenny came by the trailer.
She said five minutes, so...

9
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,320
Well, there's a lot of arrows.

10
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,400
So...

11
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,522
Should I just go back to my...
No.

12
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,364
No, it's, uh...
Jenny said...

13
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,248
What did Jenny say?

14
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,930
They're...
They're putting in the arrows.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,128
Yeah, I know,
but how long?

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,085
Doll! Just find out,
will you?

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,849
'Cause the chief
is wearing moccasins here.

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,808
It's goddamn February.

19
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,246
So, what's he like, anyway?
Who?

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,606
Dutch, Reagan.

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,162
Ronnie? Ah! He's a prince.
He's a real class act.

22
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,521
Yeah.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,723
Can I get a blanket?

24
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,125
This is the actual field,
they tell me.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,080
What?
It's the actual battlefield.

26
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,962
Massacre at Sioux Falls?

27
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,770
I think 300 of your people, braves,
died here, what, 100 years ago?

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,329
I'm from New Jersey.

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,289
Sure, but...

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,646
Yeah, you're...

31
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,722
You're an Indian,
right?

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,328
So that's
gotta be, uh...

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,764
Gotta be what?

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,444
No, I'm just saying.

35
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,084
This battle, you know, was the last
big battle before the end of...

36
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,127
And what came after...

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
Whew, look, I'm a Jew,
so believe me, I know tribulation.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,805
Yeah. Smoke?

39
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,762
Any minute,
he'll be out.

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,161
Right. Nobody moves.
Everybody is still dead.

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,127
It is a crisis of confidence.

42
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,409
It is a crisis that strikes
at the very heart and soul

43
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,288
and spirit of
our national will.

44
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,169
We can see this crisis

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,050
in the growing doubt about
the meaning of our own lives.

46
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,686
And in the loss of
a unity of purpose.

47
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,765
Is he kidding me?

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,444
...has been taken
out of the home

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,567
of John Wayne Gacy and...

50
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,843
The erosion of our confidence
in the future...

51
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,647
...is threatening
to destroy the social

52
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,843
and the political
fabric of America.

53
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,240
That's what I'm trying
to engage with here,

54
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,561
is this untapped
potential of yours

55
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,800
to sort of think
a little bit.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,849
Confidence in the future
has supported everything else.

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,086
Hey there.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,127
Sorry.

59
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,281
Are you kidding me?

60
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,447
You said noon, yeah?

61
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,805
Are you kidding me?

62
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,370
Now, hold on now...

63
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,363
I said 11 :00, not noon.
What?

64
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,725
Say that again.
Okay.

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,846
Say it again.

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,159
Okay, okay.

67
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,523
Where's the goddamn money?

68
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,449
Gave it to Ollie,
like, yesterday.

69
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,961
Don't lie.

70
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,963
I mean, I'm getting it.
It's just a little late.

71
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,803
The hell you say,
I did the rounds.

72
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,810
Everybody paid.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,365
Of course
they're gonna say that.

74
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,884
So you got the money?

75
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,449
Well, you know, maybe I needed
it for me, for something I...

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,528
No, you earn for the family,
not for yourself.

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,680
Yeah.

78
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,923
But you're the oldest and then
there's Bear, and that's the throne.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,129
What am I ever gonna be except
the kid you send out for milk?

80
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,689
You're a Gerhardt.

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,728
That's like Jupiter telling Pluto,
"Hey, you're a planet, too."

82
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,447
What?

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,802
If I'm this royalty,

84
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,249
how come you got me doing bullshit
collections like some nobody Chump?

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,081
Everybody earns.
That's the law.

86
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,288
Yeah, but what if I got ambitions,
you know?

87
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,091
You wear short pants
till you prove you're a man.

88
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,526
I'm a man.

89
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,290
You're the comic
in a piece of bubble gum!

90
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,447
Well, I mean, says you.

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,370
You got till tomorrow to bring
the collection money you owe.

92
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,768
Or what?

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,649
You make me wait for you again,
I'll cleave your skull.

94
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,639
This is the month's cash,
all in.

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,521
You'll see the problem
right away.

96
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,000
Light?

97
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,644
Mmm.

98
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,441
About time.

99
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,009
Give me a break.

100
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,608
Soon as you ladies
are done dancing...

101
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,523
You're right.
We're light.

102
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,004
Even though the transport
dollars went up.

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,768
It's the local business.

104
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,764
Gambling and drugs.
And whores.

105
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,848
Aren't any good
at this, huh?

106
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,930
Don't pin this on me.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,206
Or me.

108
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,841
We earned.

109
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,125
But not Rye.
No.

110
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,569
But even without his nut,
we shouldn't be this short.

111
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,324
It's like we're a balloon
leaking air all over.

112
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,447
Spit it out.

113
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,129
What are we
talking about here?

114
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,281
Tell me, God damn it.

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,250
Another outfit.

116
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,762
I'm taking care of it.

117
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,846
From the south.
Don't know where.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,321
I said I'd handle it.
They're coming hard.

119
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,807
Son, I am the iron fist of God.

120
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,805
There's not a sane man in three
states who would dare to...

121
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,723
Some pissant crew
from south no-place?

122
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,004
You bring me these
hirnlose Mutterfotzen

123
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,242
and I'll grind their
bones to make my...

124
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,406
Otto?

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,880
Otto.

126
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,404
All right? Hear me.

127
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,408
I'm saying tomorrow has never
been closer than it is right now.

128
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,768
It's 11:00
in the morning.

129
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,363
Metaphorically, I mean.

130
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,245
Hi, friend.

131
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,681
Be with you in a...
Check never came is my point.

132
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,009
I'm owed for work I done.
Me and the boys, we're owed.

133
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,450
Giddy-up there, cowboy.

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,250
Wait your turn,
short round.

135
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
What'd you say?

136
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,490
You heard me.

137
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,485
Jesus! Just, uh...

138
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,441
It's in the mail, okay?
The check.

139
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,649
Just... If it hasn't come by Tuesday,
I'll write you another.

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah, that's right.
You better run.

141
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,929
Come on now!

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,365
He could call a cop!

143
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,890
He's not calling anybody.

144
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,929
Guys like that,
they're just big on the outside.

145
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,769
So, where's this
miracle contraption?

146
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,450
Behold the future.
I'm talking money, hand over fist.

147
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,085
A typewriter.

148
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,687
A self-correcting IBM Selectric
Two electric typewriter

149
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,761
with patented high-speed typeball.

150
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,171
They're not just for women anymore.

151
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,845
And you're sure we're the only...

152
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,922
Sole distributor, Midwest region.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,325
Assuming you're willing to forget
certain debts owed to your family

154
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,447
from the, uh...
Gambling.

155
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,443
Yeah, which, you know,
I'm not proud.

156
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,330
So soon as you talk
to the judge

157
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,562
and she unfreezes
the accounts,

158
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,529
well, then, we can turn
on the money spigot.

159
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,086
The what?

160
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,124
The spigot?
It's like where you hook up a hose?

161
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,088
Like a fire hose?

162
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,806
Any hose.

163
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,567
I'm saying once we get those typewriters,
the money, there'll be no stopping it.

164
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,730
Ah, which judge again?

165
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,841
People of the Earth,
can you hear me?

166
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,369
Came a voice from the sky
on that magical night

167
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,364
And in the colors
of a thousand sunsets

168
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,246
They traveled through the
world on a silvery light

169
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,525
You're the comic in
a piece of bubble gum!

170
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
The people of the Earth
stood waiting

171
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,370
Watching as the ships
came one by one

172
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,524
Setting fire to the sky
as they landed

173
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,606
Carrying to the world
children of the sun

174
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,125
Welcome to Waffle Hut!

175
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,360
Shit, lady.
Table or booth?

176
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,043
Just, uh, the counter.

177
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,446
Special's tuna melt and fries.
Pie's humbleberry.

178
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,884
Just coffee.

179
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,761
Everything's taken
care of, I see.

180
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,326
Sugar?

181
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,571
Uh, ma'am, you're
freaking me out a little.

182
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,244
So, now he squeezes and the
mustard goes all over his shirt.

183
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,799
He didn't have another shirt
to wear, so...

184
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,129
I'm gonna pay up now.
I'll meet you at the counter.

185
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,370
How was everything?

186
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,929
Real good.
Oh,good.

187
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,288
I'll get your change.

188
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,643
There you are.
Thank you.

189
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,043
Hi.
No.

190
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,640
What do you mean, "No"?

191
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,961
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying.

192
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,644
First of all,
I'm not selling anything.

193
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,683
And second... You need to
make me another burger.

194
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,888
This one's a coaster.
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,970
Hey. Your Majesty.

196
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,051
You're gonna change your mind
about something. A case.

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,405
Or what?

198
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,684
Or you'll find out
is what.

199
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,486
This isn't one of those optional
"check A or B" scenarios.

200
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,244
I'm gonna change
your mind.

201
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,051
One day the Devil
came to God and said,

202
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,806
"Let's make a bet, between you
and me, for the soul of a man."

203
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,688
And from on high they looked down
on Job, a devout man, religious,

204
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,923
and the Devil said,
"I can change his mind

205
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,411
"and make him
curse your name."

206
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,330
And God said,
"Try and you will only fail."

207
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,609
So the Devil begins.

208
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,725
He kills Job's herds
and takes his fields.

209
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,928
He plagues him with boils and
throws him on the ash heap.

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,243
But Job's mind
remains unchanged.

211
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,524
So I ask you, son,

212
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,687
if the Devil couldn't
change Job's mind,

213
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,167
how the hell are you
gonna change mine?

214
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,726
What?

215
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,043
You're a little dim,
aren't you?

216
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,490
Listen, this is...

217
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,650
There's two ways this can go...
Is one of them the hard way?

218
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,370
Easy...
You know what?

219
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,490
There's a fella who needs to get
his hands on some typewriters.

220
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,520
And you're gonna... Ah, Christ,
you're with that fool.

221
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,965
Yeah, you're...

222
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,799
Son, you have three seconds to pick
your ass up and get out of here,

223
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,644
or I'm gonna
squash you like a bug.

224
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,840
Okay, look, bitch.
I'm the one doing...

225
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,408
God damn, my eyes!

226
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,642
Now scram before
I call the cops!

227
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,767
Oh, crap.

228
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,611
Shit.

229
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,243
Shit.

230
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,605
Shit.

231
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,284
Shit.

232
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,207
”Oh, Wocky, cried Joe. 'See
what you've done, Polly Pepper?

233
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,210
"But Polly didn't hear.

234
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,048
"Over the big,
flat door stone she sped,

235
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,044
"and met Ben with little
David coming in the gate.

236
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,962
"His face was
just like Franzie's.

237
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,247
"With a cold,
heavy feeling in her heart,

238
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,567
"Polly realized
that this was no play.

239
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,563
"Oh, Ben,' she cried,
flinging her arms

240
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,688
"around his neck
and bursting into tears.

241
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,411
"Don't, please.
I wish you wouldn't.

242
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,130
"Franzie's got them
and that's enough.'

243
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,843
"Got what?' asked Ben.

244
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,481
"Well, Davie's eyes grew to
their widest proportions.

245
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,843
"Oh, measles,' cried Polly,
bursting out afresh.

246
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,209
"The hatefulist,
horridist measles.

247
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,085
"Now you're taken.'

248
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,845
"Oh, no, I ain't,'
responded Ben cheerfully.

249
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
"Who knew
what measles were?

250
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,962
"Wait, now Polly, I'm all right.

251
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,044
"Only my head aches
and my eyes feel funny.'

252
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,762
"Polly, only half-reassured,
gulped down her sobs

253
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,003
"and the sorrowful trio
repaired to Mother.

254
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,686
"Oh, dear me,'
ejaculated Mrs. Pepper,

255
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,202
"sinking in a chair
at the dismay

256
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,249
"at the sight of
Ben's red face.

257
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,321
"Whatever we do now..."

258
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,289
This is a funny book, huh?

259
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,088
Yeah.
Yeah.

260
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,401
Phone call, hon.
It's the shop.

261
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,087
Okay, you.
Sleep, huh?

262
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,009
I'll be back in a minute to tuck you in.
Okay.

263
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,807
Murder, Eunice says. Three of them.
Over at the Waffle Hut.

264
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,242
Hey, uh, you had
your thing today?

265
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,651
Yeah, this morning.

266
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,244
You feel okay?

267
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
Compared to what?
Love Canal?

268
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,244
Hmm?

269
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,599
Solverson.

270
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,929
Yeah, okay.
Tell him not to go inside.

271
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,849
Hank on his way?
Yeah.

272
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,400
Called and he says he'll meet you there.
Have a good one.

273
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,130
Okay, you, too.

274
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,049
Gotta go, hon. You okay
getting her to bed?

275
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,328
Yeah, she's six.
Not, you know, Pol Pot.

276
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,560
Okay. Call if you need,
you know, whatever.

277
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,963
I left my rig there.
I hope that's okay.

278
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,246
I'm the one
who called it in, see?

279
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,201
Stopped for waffles,
you know.

280
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,203
With the blueberries?

281
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,528
They come frozen this time
of year, I know, but...

282
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,008
I put my coat
on her.

283
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,010
Seemed only right.

284
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,965
Yeah.

285
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,931
Yeah, it's okay
about the coat, or...

286
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,365
Yeah.

287
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,088
Well, this is a deal.

288
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,250
I count three dead.

289
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,970
Saw the waitress in
the parking lot? Mmm.

290
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,369
Think she caught one there,
then staggered out.

291
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,125
Gunman followed,
made things permanent.

292
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,604
That's Henry Blanton.

293
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,605
Got the single-season touchdown
record in 10th grade.

294
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,765
Thirty-one.

295
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,450
Still stands.

296
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,082
Yeah. Don't know her.

297
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:35,604
North Dakota plates
on the Mercedes outside.

298
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,690
Tourist,
you're thinking?

299
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,326
Mmm.

300
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,724
How's Betsy?

301
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,010
You mean you didn't call
her before you came over?

302
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,085
Well, yeah.

303
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,000
Just being polite.

304
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,000
Give you a chance
to talk about your feelings,

305
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,769
should you be so disposed.

306
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,644
She's good. Yeah.

307
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,443
Ordered this kit of recipe cards.
Saw it on the TV.

308
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,450
So now every night,
we eat  delicacies of the world.

309
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,609
Hmm. Some men like that.

310
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,845
Variety.
Mmm.

311
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,006
She put a soufflé
on the table last night.

312
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,844
Perfectly good casserole. Then lit
it on fire with a kitchen match.

313
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,567
Huh?

314
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,002
Oh, which reminds me,
you're invited for dinner tomorrow.

315
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,203
6:00?
Mmm-hmm.

316
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,448
I'll bring you
a suit of armor.

317
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,971
Skid marks.

318
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,124
Yeah, I see them.

319
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,648
Of course, connecting those
to this deal here

320
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,564
would be what we call
jumping to a conclusion.

321
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:17,366
Based on the
number of bodies,

322
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,521
I'm thinking we got one car
too many in the parking lot.

323
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,080
Yeah.

324
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,086
So, the shooter's got a wound or
two in him from the steak knife.

325
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,244
Two blood trails lead out, one
to the waitress, now deceased,

326
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,125
the other
to the road here,

327
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,442
where he absconds,
leaving a few dollars behind.

328
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,721
Uh-huh.

329
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,481
Why not take
his own car?

330
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,403
Unclear at this time.

331
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,449
There's a shoe
in that tree.

332
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,644
There sure is.

333
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,446
So, uh, this a local matter
or the state police want it?

334
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,851
We do not.

335
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,766
Local matter it is.

336
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,762
Of course, any support
the state can provide...

337
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,490
Yeah, of course.
Mmm.

338
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,079
See you tomorrow night, then,eh?
6:00.

339
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,128
Be ready for anything.

340
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,528
That's a shoe,
all right.

341
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,325
Okay then.

342
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,121
Noreen?

343
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,601
Mmm?

344
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,609
Ed's leaving.

345
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,290
Okay then.

346
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,490
Oh, hey, you may as well
take these with you.

347
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,044
Boolie Hendricks paid,
but never picked them up.

348
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,451
Chops.
Mmm.

349
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,611
Wasted meat's a crime.
Or it should be.

350
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,688
Okay then.
Okay then.

351
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,000
Okay then.

352
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,604
B-8.

353
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,690
B-8.

354
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,364
So, Ho Chi Minh...

355
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,207
Jesus, kid, keep up.
Ho Chi Minh was just a front man.

356
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,763
Enemy number one,
straight out of central casting.

357
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,487
AKA a stuffed shirt for the
military industrial complex.

358
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,246
The what's that now?

359
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,481
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

360
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,451
Ike's farewell address?
The military industrial complex.

361
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,881
Wheels inside wheels.
Special interests.

362
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,484
N-33.

363
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,403
N-33.

364
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,208
I thought there'd be
a band tonight.

365
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,882
Boys.
I-17.

366
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,327
I-17.

367
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,040
Balls.

368
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,883
Tell this dipshit pissant
about Ike's farewell address.

369
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,040
You mean the military
industrial complex?

370
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,044
See? He knows.

371
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,801
Of course, we've been to war.
Nothing complex about it.

372
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,006
How come you're in uniform then, Lou?
Didn't you work this morning?

373
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,319
Three dead
at the Waffle Hut.

374
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,810
No shit.

375
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,611
Yeah, a real mess.
Women, too.

376
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,930
Hank's thinking
botched robbery.

377
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,805
Oh, sure. That's what
they want you to think.

378
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,365
Who?

379
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,560
They.

380
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,005
B-11.

381
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,923
You know, the powers that be.
It's a classic story.

382
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,606
Oswald acted alone.
The girl in the polka dot dress.

383
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,490
The what now?

384
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,640
The girl in...

385
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,520
After Kennedy,
the other was shot.

386
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,365
Robert, in LA.

387
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,681
People saw a woman
in a polka dot dress

388
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,490
running out of the hotel
yelling, "We got him."

389
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,403
But who do they arrest?

390
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,086
Uh...

391
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,048
An Arab.
Oh, yeah.

392
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,530
Racist pricks.

393
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,410
It's a diner robbery
in Minnesota, Karl.

394
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,284
Not a presidential
assassination.

395
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,006
Oh, sure, that's how it starts,
with something small.

396
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:26,646
Like a break-in
at the Watergate Hotel.

397
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,040
But just watch. This thing's
only getting bigger.

398
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,691
G-53.

399
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,809
G-53.

400
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,403
Well, I better get home.

401
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,810
Betsy had her chemo today.

402
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,007
God!

403
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,851
What is it, Karl?

404
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,730
It's just...

405
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:50,002
God damn.
Unacceptable is what it is.

406
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,480
A woman like that
in the prime of her...

407
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,804
With a young daughter.

408
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,845
N-40.

409
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,529
Tell her if John McCain could hold
out for five-and-a-half years

410
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,205
against Viet Cong
thumbscrews,

411
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,851
she can beat this cancer
bullshit in her sleep.

412
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,167
I'll make sure
to mention that.

413
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,923
I don't worry

414
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,727
Long as you're by my side

415
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:20,405
Hey, hon.
In the kitchen.

416
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:27,126
Boolie Hendricks paid for chops,
never picked them up.

417
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,851
So I figured...

418
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,599
Hi.
Hi.

419
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,728
Uh, hon, you're getting
blood on the tile.

420
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,608
Sorry, I'll put them
in the fridge.

421
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,330
Hamburger Helper?

422
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,044
And Tater Tots.
Yum.

423
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,165
Should I...

424
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,605
Oh, hon. Don't.

425
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,329
I just got
that stuff organized.

426
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,243
Yeah, but it's my chair.
Where am I supposed to...

427
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,367
Well, sit there, huh?
Yeah.

428
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,171
I'll move that
stuff tomorrow. Promise.

429
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,528
Bon appétit.
Mmm.

430
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,721
So, you think there was
an accomplice in a getaway car?

431
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,165
Your dad called.

432
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,605
You know him.

433
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,363
He likes to talk things through
before he goes to bed.

434
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,443
We got glasses.

435
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,202
Tastes different
in a glass.

436
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,802
Molly go down okay?
Mmm-hmm.

437
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,650
You know,
I forgot earlier.

438
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,882
She made you something
at school today. Yeah.

439
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,809
She knows
I don't smoke, right?

440
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,161
You could start.

441
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,802
Your dad said he'd be over
Sunday in a suit of armor.

442
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,010
Ugh, jeez. You light one
soufflé on fire...

443
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,561
So, I'm getting excited
about this seminar.

444
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,126
The which?

445
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,646
You remember, hon. It's next weekend.
Constance is taking me.

446
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,599
Lifespring. Everybody's doing it.
Oh, yeah.

447
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,681
I really think this course is gonna
help me actualize, you know, fully.

448
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,360
Re-examine old
reflex patterns.

449
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,601
The ones that keep
my life from working.

450
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,726
From...

451
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,724
'Cause we're
doing great, yeah?

452
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,887
Oh, yeah.

453
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,882
I just mean me,
you know, as a person.

454
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,851
Yeah.
Yeah.

455
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,085
Well, Bud asked again if I was interested
in maybe taking over the butcher shop.

456
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,606
Mmm.

457
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,570
Said he's thinking
of retiring end of the year.

458
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,960
Just had the end
of the year, huh?

459
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,407
Yeah, I guess
he means this year,

460
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,204
but wouldn't that
be great?

461
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,081
Me owning the shop.

462
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,527
And maybe you take over
the salon one day,

463
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:09,246
you know, unless we got a
whole litter of kids by then.

464
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,123
Yeah, that's...
We talked about that.

465
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,563
We're trying, but it
takes time, you know?

466
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,768
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

467
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,400
Though, uh...

468
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,201
Hon...

469
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,085
"Trying." I mean...

470
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,722
Last time I checked, there's just the
one way to make a baby, you know.

471
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,164
Did that last weekend,
didn't we?

472
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,686
It was Bear Lake last weekend.
You said you didn't wanna...

473
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,126
Not with Kevin and Sally.
Hon...

474
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,327
I just... I just...

475
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,563
I just love you, is all.

476
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,208
So, so much.

477
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,043
And, come on,
our kids would be amazing.

478
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,768
Oh, shoot.
Here.

479
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,648
Hon, let me.
No, it's fine.

480
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,369
I'm such
a bumble sometimes.

481
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,844
What the heck?

482
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,288
I love you too, hon.
So, so much.

483
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,371
Maybe we should

484
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,364
maybe do it right now.

485
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,161
Here? No, silly. In the bedroom.

486
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,561
Come on.

487
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,570
Jeez. I better go see
what that...

488
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,445
We can... I'll wear
that nightie you like!

489
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,367
What the...

490
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,481
Hon?

491
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,050
Didn't I tell you?

492
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,289
I kind of hit a deer.

493
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,166
You hit a...

494
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,280
Well, you okay?
Yeah.

495
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,931
No. I'm just,
you know, shook up mostly.

496
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,530
Jeez.

497
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,322
Well, insurance
should cover most of...

498
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,842
Actually, I think I need
to sit down, hon.

499
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,929
Can we go
in the kitchen?

500
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,846
Heck, hon,
did you bring the deer home?

501
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,411
Hon, don't.

502
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,050
Hon.

503
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,204
Hon, don't.

504
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,246
Hon!

505
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,405
Come back.
Hey.

506
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,641
Don't.

507
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Jeez.

508
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,449
There's a...

509
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,443
There's a man...
There's a man in the...

510
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,605
Call the...

511
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,527
Call the police...
Call the...

512
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,007
Oh, my God.

513
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,846
Oh, my God.

514
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,324
Oh, my God.

515
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,523
Hon?
Jeez,hon!

516
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,849
Sorry. Are you okay?
No. It's...

517
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm fine.

518
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,164
Who...
You gotta believe me.

519
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,164
I thought he was dead.

520
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,240
What?

521
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,324
When I hit him, I thought he was...
You hit him?

522
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,684
You hit him with the car?
You said a deer.

523
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,726
You hit him.

524
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,570
Why didn't you go to the
police or the hospital?

525
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,889
He ran out
into the road, hon.

526
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,010
What was I supposed
to do?

527
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,291
Yeah, so you brought him home.
You made dinner.

528
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,726
Hamburger Helper.

529
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,003
I panicked, okay?

530
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:24,048
Yeah, well,
you gotta call the police.

531
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,365
Why didn't you call the police?
No.

532
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,481
We gotta... Maybe he's not...
No, no.

533
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,483
No, I...
Hon, listen to me.

534
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,411
Iran over him!
Hit and run!

535
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,880
And then you stabbed him
with a gardening tool.

536
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,246
The cops, do you think
they're gonna believe us?

537
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,925
I don't know, but people
are gonna look for him.

538
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,771
But, look, look,
I was careful.

539
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,603
I drove the back way
all the way home.

540
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,202
You drove the...

541
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,369
Hon, a man's dead.

542
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,001
Look, that's why
we have to clean it up.

543
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,762
And tell people
I hit a deer, or...

544
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,239
We could run!

545
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,360
What?

546
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,722
Go to California!

547
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
No.

548
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,010
We have a life here, hon, a family.
I'm gonna buy the shop.

549
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,081
Okay then.
Okay then.

550
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,206
Okay then.

551
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,324
And we're gonna
start a family.

552
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,050
Well, start again,
I'm saying.

553
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,760
I don't want to.

554
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:25,800
Okay, then...

555
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,322
Then, hon, look at me.

556
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,121
If we're gonna get
clear of this,

557
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,282
then we're gonna
have to clean it up.

558
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,809
Pretend it didn't happen.

559
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,327
'Cause if this comes out...

560
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,766
If this... Then all
the things you want,

561
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,005
that we want,
that's over.

562
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,402
I go to jail,
and maybe you also.

563
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,608
And then there's no shop
and no family.

564
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,327
No kids.

565
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,001
Okay.

566
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,530
Okay then. We...

567
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,684
We clean it up.

568
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,320
We clean it up.

569
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:49,326
Well...

570
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,010
Should we call
that Saturday?

571
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,565
Suppose we better.

572
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,682
She'll be up at 5:00 anyway,
wanting to play dolls.

573
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,842
And I know how fond you are
of your doll-playing time.

574
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,570
Good night,
Mr. Solverson.

575
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,204
Good night,
Mrs. Solverson,

576
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,043
and all the ships
at sea.

577
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,610
Otto?

578
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:01,646
No!

579
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,610
Otto!

580
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
No!

581
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:06,641
No!

582
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
Otto!

583
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:09,721
Hold him!

584
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:11,884
Go out front! Go now!

585
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,043
Now! Otto!

586
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,050
Call a doctor! Go!

587
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,929
So, as you see on page 16
of the prospectus,

588
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,527
the main component of our
Northern Expansion Strategy

589
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:46,960
involves the absorption of the
Gerhardt Family Syndicate,

590
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,088
headquartered in Fargo, ND.

591
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,804
Now, the Gerhardts control
trucking and distribution

592
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,121
for the entire
northern Midwest.

593
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:02,371
It's a family business started
in 1931 by Dieter Gerhardt.

594
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,842
Now deceased, and taken over
in 1950 by his son, Otto.

595
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,242
Now, not in the report,
but of relevance to this meeting,

596
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,686
old Otto had
a stroke yesterday

597
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,240
on the family compound
in North Dakota.

598
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,123
Leaving who in charge?

599
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,166
Unclear.

600
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,289
His wife, Floyd, she's tough,
but, you know, a girl.

601
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,681
And then there are the three sons.
Dodd, Bear and Rye.

602
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:37,043
And of course, they all want
their shot at the throne.

603
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,128
Which the boys in Research think
provides a tactical opportunity

604
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:47,081
for us to move aggressively to
acquire or absorb their operation.

605
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,650
And if you can't,

606
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,719
and the current
business owners resist?

607
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,210
We liquidate.

608
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:09,280
Approved.

609
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,648
Go to sleep,
you little babe

610
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:20,523
Go to sleep,
you little babe

611
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,599
Your mama's gone away
and your daddy's gonna stay

612
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,605
Didn't leave nobody
but the baby

613
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:38,802
Go to sleep,
you little babe

614
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,567
Everybody's gone
in the cotton and the corn

615
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:47,963
Didn't leave nobody
but the baby

616
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:56,963
You're a sweet little babe

617
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,686
Honey in the rock
and the sugar don't stop

618
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,969
Gonna bring a bottle
to the baby

619
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:15,206
Don't you weep, pretty babe

620
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,447
You and me
and the devil makes three

621
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:24,161
Don't need
no other lovin', baby

622
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:32,371
Go to sleep,
you little babe

623
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:37,601
Come and lay your bones
on the alabaster stones

624
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,400
And be my ever-lovin' baby
